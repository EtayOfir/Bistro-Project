We are **Etay, Yuval, Ori, Linoy & Yarden** 👥.

We are a team of software engineering students at **Braude College of Engineering**, developing **Bistro** as part of the “Engineering Methods for Software Systems Development” course.

## 🚀 Vision
Our goal is to deliver a reliable, modular, and user-friendly application that answers the **“Bistro Story”** challenge. We aim to produce a fully operational restaurant management app that embodies software engineering best practices—usability, modularity, and maintainability—while improving efficiency in a busy restaurant environment.

## 💻 About The Project

* 📅 **Table Reservations:** Smart management of bookings and time slots.
* 📋 **Wait-list Management:** Efficient handling of walk-in customers.
* 👤 **Customer Profiles:** Tracking preferences and history.
* 📊 **Real-time Reporting:** Insights into restaurant performance.
